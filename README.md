### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Thara**](), a computer science undergraduate and software developer with a strong interest in full stack and cross platform application development.

I enjoy building end to end products from intuitive mobile interfaces to scalable backend systems  and I’m especially interested in clean architecture, system design, and AI assisted software.

Outside of development, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, learning about applied AI, and building side projects that turn ideas into real, usable products.
